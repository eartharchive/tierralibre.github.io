Our goal is to build an Ecological and Smart Farm School in La Palma, Spain.
We will be using Permaculture and Agroforestry principles. 
The smart part will be be provided by using open source software and technology.
Software to map and help make designs.
Hardware and software to capture data; environmental data, animal data.
Everything we learn will be posted in this website which is fully open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), so fill free to fork it and help us improve it.

Lot's of things to learn and share. But we believe that we learn by doing!
