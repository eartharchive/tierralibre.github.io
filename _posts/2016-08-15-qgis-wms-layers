title: QGIS WMS Layers
subtitle: Using WMS layers with QGIs
---
Welcome!
In today's post we have a screencast on how to add WMS layers to [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) so we can use it for our maps. This can be seen as a quick introduction to QGIS.
QGIS is a great mapping tool which can use to help us with our permaculture designs.

(screencast ) 

The WMS sources used are the following:
- Raster: http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/mapa-raster?
- Catastro: http://ovc.catastro.meh.es/Cartografia/WMS/ServidorWMS.aspx?
- Ortophotes: http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/pnoa-ma?

There is a lot that QGIS can do and plenty of tutorials on the net.

On our next blog post we will be showing how to use LIDAR in our map and how to create a 3D model of the land and make it available online.

Here is an example: [TierraLibre ThreeJS Map](https://tierralibre.github.io/threejs/tierralibre.html) which takes a while to load and better used on the desktop.

I hope is useful, feel free to add your comments below!

Thank you!
