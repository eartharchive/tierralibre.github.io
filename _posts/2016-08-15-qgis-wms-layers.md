title: QGIS WMS Layers
subtitle: Using WMS layers with QGIs
---
Welcome!
In today's post we have a screencast on how to add WMS layers to [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) so we can use it for our maps. This can be seen as a quick introduction to QGIS. (I need to find a better way of recording the sound, tips welcome.)
QGIS is a great mapping tool which can be used to help us with our permaculture designs.

The WMS sources used are the following:  
- Raster: http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/mapa-raster?  
- Catastro: http://ovc.catastro.meh.es/Cartografia/WMS/ServidorWMS.aspx?  
- Ortophotos: http://www.ign.es/wms-inspire/pnoa-ma?  

Most countries offer this services, for example the Dutch: https://www.pdok.nl with a quick google search it should be easy to find the one for your country.

There is a lot that QGIS can do and plenty of tutorials on the net.

On our next blog post we will be showing you how to use LIDAR in our map and how to create a 3D model of the land and make it available online.

Here is an example: [TierraLibre ThreeJS Map](https://tierralibre.github.io/threejs/tierralibre.html) It takes a while to load and it's better used on the desktop.

I hope you find this useful, feel free to add your comments below!

Thank you!
