Hello world!

So here is our first post on tierralibre!
We decided to use open source software and hosting. We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for blogging, simple, plain text, no database no complication.

For hosting we decided to use [GitHub Pages](https://github.com) it's free and where most of the open source projects live.

We have used a theme for Jekyll which works in phones, computers, everywhere; it's simple and beatiful. [Beautiful Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme).
In the link above you can find detailed instructions on how to have your website running in minutes.

But in essence you need a github account, then you can navigate to the link above containing the theme and fork it. (When you fork a repository, you make it your own version and you can make changes on it).

We will be posting all of our designs in github. So everybody is welcome to fork it and send changes, improvements, whatever you think is useful. Github is a great platform to collaborate designs. 
We will further show how we can use github to make a collaborative permaculture design and use forking and commits to communicate and share changes.

Enjoy!
